        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Megan, and I am a former science teacher looking forward to changing careers into technology.
            I have been learning how to code on my own for the last 4 months, and am so excited to be a member of the newest cohort at 
            UT's Coding Bootcamp!</p>
        <p>Besides my newfound interest in coding, I am a food fanatic - baking and cooking are some of my favorite things to
            do. I am also a gardener, with raised-bed vegetable gardens along with a few flower beds. I love camping and hiking, and especially love visiting national parks.</p>

            a message.</p>
